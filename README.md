# FileSaverJsGwt

FileSaverJsGwt is a tiny and trivial GWT wrapper around filesaver.js library. The purpose of the library is to allow file downloads on the client side.

## Usage

1. Add the library to your classpath, either via jar, or via whatever build system you are familiar with.

2. Add the following line to your .gwt.xml file

>              <inherits name='org.ainslec.filesaver.FileSaver'/>

3. Use the FileSaver.saveText() or FileSaver.saveBlob() methods to save text or binary information to a file via the browser.

>              // To save as text
>              FileSaver.saveText(fileName, fileText);
>              // To save binary information
>              FileSaver.saveBlob(fileName, blob); // The blob must be a JavascriptObject representing a standard Blob object.

## Compatibility

Requires a modern version of IE (10+) or Firefox (25+) or Chrome or Safari (6.1+). See https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js for more details.
